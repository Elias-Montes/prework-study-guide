## Description

I bulit this project to prepare for the start of bootcamp and to see how well I am able to understand coding on my own. From building this project I have realized that I am fully capable of doing this and understanding it. I had motivation to complete this project so I can see what I am capable of and by doing so I have given myself more motivation for the future. I learned the basic functions to github, css, javascript, and HTML.
